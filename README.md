This is my script for handwritten digit recognition competition on Kaggle.<br/>
It uses a simple CNN with 4 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers (including final softmax layer).<br/>

Directory Structure:<br/>

main.py : Contains the model, training and testing part.<br/>

digit-recognizer/ : Should contain train.csv and test.csv files.<br/>

Training Accuracy: 99.7% (on 40000 images) <br/>
Validation Accuracy: 99.385% (on 2000 images) <br/>
